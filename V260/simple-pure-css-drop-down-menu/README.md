# Simple Pure CSS Drop Down Menu

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/philhoyt/pen/DzXPoZ](https://codepen.io/philhoyt/pen/DzXPoZ).

I was in need of a very style agnostic drop down menu and struggling to find one. So I built one!

I have made subtle change for submenus to use top and bottom padding in conjunction with a smaller line-height to accommodate multi-lined sub-menu items.
