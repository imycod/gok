# The Solar System (To Scale)

Use your arrow keys for now! 

Right now, it starts getting buggy once you go as far as Jupiter, reason being, Jupiter is really, really far away... even at this scale. So the distance of X,Y and the length of the vector to the sun starts to exceed javascript maximum number capacity. I'll work on finding a way to get around this...

And I know, I know, getting around takes far too long right now... but in my defense, it is the solar system, it's accurate.  I will be updating this to include a "warp" feature that travels in increments of the speed of light.


TODO:
  -  Current speed (in km)
  -  Better planets
  -  Saturns rings (already have space debri coded, I just need to put it in and style it)
  -  Moons
  -  An "Enter Orbit" button that takes your current orbit radius and adds the needed velocity vector to enter a stable orbit
